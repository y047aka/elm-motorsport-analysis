# Data Processing

## CLI Tools

The project includes command-line tools for processing motorsport data:

- `cli/src/csv_to_json.ts` - CSV to JSON conversion
- `cli/benchmark` - Performance testing
- `cli/fixture` - Test data fixtures

## Data Flow

1. Raw motorsport data (CSV) ingested from timing services
2. Data processed using CLI tools into JSON format
3. Processed data consumed by Elm application
4. Visualization and analysis using core modules

## Data Types

Common motorsport data types:

- Lap timing data (lap number, sector times, total time)
- Position data
- Car/driver information
- Race events and flags
- Pit stop information

## Performance Considerations

- Benchmarks ensure processing performance
- Memory-efficient processing for large race datasets
- Optimized JSON output for Elm consumption
