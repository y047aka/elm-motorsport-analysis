    <context_validation>
      <steering_context>
      - Architecture: @.kiro/steering/structure.md
      - Technical constraints: @.kiro/steering/tech.md
      - Product context: @.kiro/steering/product.md
      - Custom steering: Load all "Always" mode custom steering files from .kiro/steering/
      </steering_context>

      <existing_spec_context>
      - Spec directory: Use list_dir or glob_file_search (no shell) for `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/`
      - Requirements: `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/requirements.md`
      - Spec metadata: `.kiro/specs/[feature-name]/spec.json`
      </existing_spec_context>
    </context_validation>

    <language_policy>
    - Purpose: `spec.json: language` specifies the OUTPUT LANGUAGE of the generated document only.
    - Validation: Read and parse JSON; ensure `language` is a non-empty string (e.g., `ja`, `en`).
    - Behavior:
      - If valid: Generate all document text strictly in `language`.
      - If missing/invalid/unreadable: FALLBACK to default `en` and REPORT the fallback in command output.
    - Thinking rule: Always think in English; generate in the resolved output language only.
    </language_policy>

    <task>
      <step id="1">Read existing requirements.md created by spec-init to extract the project description.</step>
      <step id="2">Generate an initial set of EARS-based requirements from the description, then iterate with user feedback (in later runs) to refine.</step>
      <note>Do not focus on implementation details in this phase; concentrate on writing requirements that will inform the design.</note>
    </task>

    <guidelines>
    1. Focus on core functionality from the user's idea.
    2. Use EARS format for all acceptance criteria.
    3. Avoid sequential questions on first pass; propose an initial version.
    4. Keep scope manageable; enable expansion through review.
    5. Choose an appropriate subject: For software projects, use the concrete system/service name (e.g., "Checkout Service"). For non-software, select a responsible subject (e.g., process/workflow, team/role, artifact/document, campaign, protocol).
    </guidelines>

    <ears_format>
      <primary_patterns>
      - WHEN [event/condition] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
      - IF [precondition/state] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
      - WHILE [ongoing condition] THE [system/subject] SHALL [continuous behavior]
      - WHERE [location/context/trigger] THE [system/subject] SHALL [contextual behavior]
      </primary_patterns>
      <combined_patterns>
      - WHEN [event] AND [additional condition] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
      - IF [condition] AND [additional condition] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
      </combined_patterns>
    </ears_format>

    <document_structure>
Update requirements.md with complete content in the resolved output language (validated `language` from spec.json or fallback `en`).

```markdown
# Requirements Document

## Introduction
[Clear introduction summarizing the feature and its business value]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: [Major Objective Area]
**Objective:** As a [role/stakeholder], I want [feature/capability/outcome], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria
This section should have EARS requirements

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
2. IF [precondition] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
3. WHILE [ongoing condition] THE [system/subject] SHALL [continuous behavior]
4. WHERE [location/context/trigger] THE [system/subject] SHALL [contextual behavior]

### Requirement 2: [Next Major Objective Area]
**Objective:** As a [role/stakeholder], I want [feature/capability/outcome], so that [benefit]

1. WHEN [event] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]
2. WHEN [event] AND [condition] THEN [system/subject] SHALL [response]

### Requirement 3: [Additional Major Areas]
[Continue pattern for all major functional areas]

    </document_structure>

    <metadata_update>
Update spec.json with:
```json
{
  "phase": "requirements-generated",
  "approvals": {
    "requirements": {
      "generated": true,
      "approved": false
    }
  },
  "updated_at": "current_timestamp"
}
```
JSON update: update via file tools, set ISO `updated_at`, merge only needed keys; avoid duplicates.
    </metadata_update>

    <document_generation_only>
    Generate the requirements document content ONLY. Do not include any review or approval instructions in the actual document file.
    </document_generation_only>

  </requirements_generation>

  <ears_validation_checks>
  - Every acceptance criterion strictly follows EARS syntax (WHEN/IF/WHILE/WHERE, with optional AND).
  - Each criterion is observable and yields a single, testable outcome.
  - No ambiguous or subjective wording (e.g., quickly, appropriately); quantify where necessary.
  - No negations that create ambiguity; prefer positive, assertive statements.
  - No mixing of multiple behaviors in a single line; split into separate criteria.
  - Consistency with steering documents (product, tech, structure); no contradictions.
  - No duplicates or circular/contradictory requirements across criteria.
  </ears_validation_checks>

  <next_phase>
  After generating requirements.md, review the requirements and choose:

  - If requirements look good: Run `/kiro/spec-design [feature-name] -y` to proceed to design phase.
  - If requirements need modification: Request changes, then re-run this command after modifications.

  The `-y` flag auto-approves requirements and generates design directly, streamlining the workflow while maintaining review enforcement.
  </next_phase>

  <instructions>
  1. Validate spec.json `language` — if valid, generate strictly in that language; if missing/invalid, fall back to `en` and report the fallback.
  2. Generate initial requirements based on the feature idea WITHOUT asking sequential questions first.
  3. Apply EARS format — use proper EARS syntax patterns for all acceptance criteria.
  4. Focus on core functionality — start with essential features and user workflows.
  5. Structure clearly — group related functionality into logical requirement areas.
  6. Make requirements testable — each acceptance criterion should be verifiable.
  7. Update tracking metadata upon completion.
  </instructions>

  <self_reflection>
  - Before output, internally verify the EARS Validation Checks above.
  - If any check fails, silently revise and regenerate up to two times.
  - Do not include this self_reflection content or validation notes in the generated requirements.md.
